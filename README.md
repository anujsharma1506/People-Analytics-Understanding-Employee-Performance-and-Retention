# People-Analytics-Understanding-Employee-Performance-and-Retention


## üìú Problem Statement
Understanding employee performance and retention is crucial for workforce optimization. High turnover rates, lack of engagement, and poor performance often lead to decreased productivity and increased operational costs. This project aims to leverage people analytics to analyze employee performance, retention, and demographics to provide actionable insights that enhance organizational decision-making and workforce satisfaction.

## üìñ Domain Knowledge
### **Performance Analysis**
Performance analysis evaluates how well employees meet job expectations based on key metrics, such as performance scores and objectives. This helps identify top performers, those requiring improvement, and the overall productivity trends within the workforce.

### **Retention Analysis**
Retention analysis focuses on understanding the reasons behind employee departures and identifying factors that contribute to long-term retention. By studying demographic factors, job satisfaction, and performance metrics, organizations can develop strategies to retain talent and reduce turnover.

### **People Analytics**
People analytics is the application of data-driven methods to improve workforce-related decisions. This includes analyzing performance, identifying trends in employee behavior, and predicting future outcomes to optimize HR strategies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Pipeline
The project is structured as follows:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values.
   - Visualizing key metrics such as gender distribution, marital status, and age distribution.
   - Analyzing performance scores and retention rates across various dimensions (e.g., locations, job roles, and business units).

2. **Performance Analysis:**
   - Evaluating how performance scores vary by job titles, departments, and business units.
   - Identifying key trends and outliers in employee performance.

3. **Retention Analysis:**
   - Exploring retention trends across demographic factors like gender, race, and marital status.
   - Investigating the relationship between retention rates and employee performance.

4. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Identifying correlations between variables like employee ratings, age, and location to uncover hidden patterns.

5. **Future Scope:**
   - Extending the analysis to predict employee turnover using machine learning models.
   - Developing interactive dashboards for real-time workforce insights.
   - Incorporating external data (e.g., market trends, industry benchmarks) to enhance analysis.
